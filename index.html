                        <p>Al-Hakim's <em>al-Mustadrak</em> (Volume 3, p. 635) confirms Lady Asma ؓ embraced Islam at age 15, aligning with her 595 CE birth and Lady Ayesha's ؓ around 605 CE birth.<span class="citation">[Ref. 6]</span></p>

                        <p>Lady Ayesha's ؓ name appears among early Muslims, requiring her birth before the first revelation (610 CE); she was about 5 years old at acceptance of Islam.<span class="citation">[Ref. 3]</span></p>

                        <strong>Understanding Pre-Islamic Arab Puberty Age Counting</strong>
                        <p>In pre-Islamic Arabia, noble women marked puberty's onset with the Muhayyid ceremony at first menstruation, after which ages were counted from this milestone.<span class="citation">[Ref. 1]</span></p>
                        <p>When Lady Ayesha ؓ later reported her age at marriage as 6 (betrothal) and 9 (consummation), she was likely using this post-puberty counting tradition. Having reached puberty around age 9-10 (c. 614-615 CE), she would have had her Muhayyid ceremony, after which her puberty age was counted as "1" - making her actual age around 17-18 at marriage.</p>
                        <p>This cultural context explains how her statements about marriage have been misunderstood, while the chronological evidence confirms her actual birth age.</p>

                        <p>This places her betrothal around age 15-16 (c. 620 CE), approximately 6 years after her Muhayyid ceremony - which aligns with her reported "age 6" in the post-puberty counting system.</p>

                        <p>When <strong>three independent types of evidence</strong> all point to the same conclusion, we have a robust historical case. The young age narrative fails because it cannot account for all these evidence types simultaneously.</p>
                        <p>The Muhayyid ceremony explanation specifically addresses Lady Ayesha's ؓ <em>own statements</em> about her marriage, while the chronological evidence establishes her actual age independently.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>We place it chronologically where it would have actually occurred - when Lady Ayesha ؓ reached puberty around (614-615 CE). This is significant because:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It shows the ceremony would have happened <strong>before</strong> her marriage</li>
                        <li>It explains why her later statements about marriage used post-puberty counting</li>
                        <li>It demonstrates that the "age 6 and 9" reports make perfect sense as post-puberty ceremony years</li>
                        <li>It reconciles her personal testimony with the historical timeline</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This placement respects both the cultural practice and the chronological facts.</p>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Based on the chronological evidence from multiple historical sources, Lady Ayesha ؓ was born around 605 CE, accepted Islam as a child around 610 CE, reached puberty around 614-615 CE, migrated to Madina at age 17 in 622 CE, and married Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) around 623-624 CE at approximately 17-18 years of age.</p>
            <p>The claims of Lady Ayesha ؓ being 6 or 9 at marriage are misunderstandings of her using the post-puberty age counting system in her personal testimony, while the historical record confirms her actual age through multiple independent lines of evidence.</p>

        <h3>Additional Supporting Evidence</h3>
        <ol class="facts">
            <li>
                <strong>Lifespan Calculation:</strong> Lady Ayesha ؓ died at 74, living 48 years after the Prophet's (ﷺ) death (632 CE) and 9–10 years with him post-marriage—yielding an age of 17 at marriage (17 + 9 + 48 = 74).<span class="citation">[Ref. 9]</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Lady Syeda Fatima's ؓ Marriage Age:</strong> Lady Syeda Fatima ؓ, the beloved daughter of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ), was also married at 18 years of age to Imam Ali (RA), further establishing the normative marriage age for noble women in early Islam.<span class="citation">[Ref. 12]</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Islamic Jurisprudence on Marriage Age:</strong> Ottoman-era Hanafi jurists set minimum marriage age at 17 for females and 18 for males, based on Surah An-Nisa (4:6) emphasizing post-puberty maturity and wisdom (rushd) before marriage.<span class="citation">[Ref. 11]</span>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="warning">
            <h3>Important Clarification</h3>
            <p>Muslims who do not research properly and blindly justify Lady Ayesha's ؓ age wrongly as 6 or 9 to rationalize child marriage are ignoring clear Islamic guidelines. Islam emphasizes maturity, wisdom, and consent in marriage, as established in Surah An-Nisa (4:6) and practiced by the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) himself.</p>
            <p>The Ottoman-era Hanafi jurists correctly understood these principles when they established 17 as the minimum marriage age for females, reflecting the true spirit of Islamic teachings rather than cultural misinterpretations.</p>
